THE PORGRAM IS ON WIP

This won't be a really a basic thing, i'd like to make some cool visual and appropriate modern effects, feel free to suggest. 

not sure what would work and what wouldn't, it depends on my work hours put in this personal project.


TODO; - a todo list to track it (will add more later)-


[important]: turn the program from SECs to MINs.

[important]: add parameter for the MIN.

[important]: add modern themes.

[important]: add getopt

[effect]: add cast light linked to the mouse coordinates
